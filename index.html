		<h2>Hockey flex</h2>
		<p>Hockey flex refers to <strong>how stiff your hockey stick is</strong>. If you have a low flex it will bend easier and you will release the puck of your stick faster, however you will have a slower shot. If you have a higher flex you would have a harder time bending your stick. This will make you be able to shoot stronger but, you will release the puck of your stick slower.</p>
