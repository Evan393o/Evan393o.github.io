    <p>
        Badminton is a sport played with two rackets and is similar to tennis. There is a maximum of <strong>three sets, and the first to win two sets wins the game</strong>. Each set is played to 21 points, however, you must win by at least two points. When serving, there are two sides to serve from: the right side and the left side. <strong><em>You serve from the right side if your points are even and from the left side if your points are odd</em></strong>. 
        <br><br>
        The shuttlecock (normally called a birdie) is the object that players hit. The birdie must land inside the lines of the court or on the lines to count as a point. You can play singles (by yourself) or doubles (with a teammate). The court is slightly smaller when serving in doubles, but it becomes larger when not serving. In singles, the court is larger while serving but smaller after serving.

    <h2>Badminton Tension</h2>
    
        <p>
            Badminton tension refers to how tight your badminton strings are. It is an important factor as it affects your performance, control and power. A low tension is considered around 18-22lbs. Low tension will give you more power as the strings are loose. However, you will have less control. Low tension is good for beginners as you can have more power with less effort. A high tension is considered from 24-30 lbs. If you have a high tension, you will have less power, however, you will have more control. This is better for advanced players as you will have control over techniques. Many advanced players use high tension, however, some use low tension to have a stronger shot. It does not look like there is a difference however, there is a great difference that affects your gameplay. <a href="https://www.sportchek.ca/en/retail-store-services/racquet-servicing.html" target="blank">Badminton racket fixing website</a></p>
